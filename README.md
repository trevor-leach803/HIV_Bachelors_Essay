# HIV_Bachelors_Essay

This simple repository houses my Bachelor's Essay as partial fulfillment of the requirements for graduation from the Honors College at the College of Charleston with a Bachelor of Science in Biology.

The essay was written over the course of my senior year 2019-2020 and involved a significant literature review to provide an up-to-date account on the most recent advancements in prevention, treatment, and cure research for HIV.
